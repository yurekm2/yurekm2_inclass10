          This monster's origin is as of yet unknown. It is made of concrete and rebar with traces of Krylon brand spray paint. SCP-173 is extremely hostile and animate. It cannot move while viewed directly and must not be broken. Personnel at a minimum of three are assigned to enter the container and are to alert one another before blinking. It is reported to kill its victims by snapping the neck of any human it encounters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personnel report sounds of scraping stone within the container when no one is inside. The reddish-brown substance on the floor is a combination of feces and blood. The origin of these materials is unknown but must be cleaned on a bi-weekly basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          SCP-173 in order from being prevented from escaping must be kept in a locked container at all times. When personnel enter SCP-173's container, three at the minimum may enter at any time and the door is to be relocked behind them. At all times, two persons must maintain direct eye contact with SCP-173, while the third person cleans the container until all personnel leaves and relocked the container.
